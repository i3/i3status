ParseArgs

A simple function to parse the command line arguments passed to the function. 
The function does very little sanitisation on the input variables. The 
argument passed is then returned from the function.  

'''

def ParseArgs():

    # Parse our command line argument for the line name
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--line',dest='LineName',help='Specify the London line you want to report on')

    # Check if the value is blank
    Line = (args.LineName)

        print ("\nError, you must specify a line name! e.g. --line district\n")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    # Convert the line name to lower case for easy comparison
    Line = Line.lower()

    # If the line isn't in the line list, fail badly

         'bakerloo','hammersmith-city','jubilee','metropolitan',

         print ("\nError, you have specified " + Line + " as your line. You must specify one of the following: "

RetrieveTFLData

Inputs: 

Line      - Which line to retrieve information on  
Run       - Should the data retrieval be run or should the cache file be used
SFileName - The file in which to store the line status cache 

This function takes the Line variable (a name of a Transport For London line 
name) and polls the TFL API. The function then returns the current line
status for the specified line. 

'''

def RetrieveTFLData(Line,Run,SFileName):

    # TFL Unified API URL
    TFLDataURL = "https://api.tfl.gov.uk/Line/" + Line + ("/Status?detail=False"

        # Read all the information from JSON at the specified URL, can be re-done with requests?

                "retrieve the data from the TFL website")

Throttle

Inputs 

  PollIntervalMinutes - Polling interval in minutes
  Throttle            - Should we throttle the connection or not?
  TFileName           - The file where the timestamp for throttling usage is stored 

This function is used to determine whether or not the next run of the retrieval of data should run.
It retrieves the previously run time from a file in /tmp if it exists, if the file does not exist
the run status will return as 1 and the current time stamp will be written into a new file. 

If throttling is disabled, the file will be removed from /tmp and run will be set to 1.
