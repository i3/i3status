# i3status
#
# This script works with i3status, though probably not as it should :[
#
# In order to make this work with the i3status, you should modify your
# .i3status.conf and ensure it contains the following line
#
#   output_format = "i3bar"
#
# In the general section of your configuration you should have somthing similar
# to the following
#
#    status_command i3customstatus
#
# As per the i3status documentation, you should add a wrapper accessible on your
# path which executes drawing in the i3status details alongside this script. 
# A sample wrapper file can be found in the man page for i3status.
