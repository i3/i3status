i3status is a small program (about 1500 SLOC) for generating a status bar for
i3bar, dzen2, xmobar or similar programs. It is designed to be very efficient by
issuing a very small number of system calls, as one generally wants to update
such a status line every second. This ensures that even under high load, your
status bar is updated correctly. Also, it saves a bit of energy by not hogging
your CPU as much as spawning the corresponding amount of shell commands would.

i3status has the following dependencies:
 • libconfuse-dev
 • libyajl-dev
 • libasound2-dev
 • libiw-dev
 • libcap2-bin (for getting network status without root permissions)
 • asciidoc (only for the documentation)

On debian-based systems, the following line will install all requirements:
apt-get install libconfuse-dev libyajl-dev libasound2-dev libiw-dev asciidoc libcap2-bin
